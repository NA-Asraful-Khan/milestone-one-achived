                    As a web designer and web developer, polish your skills and deliver your creations most ultimately and amazingly. Along with the satisfaction that you'll gain from your job, you’ll also make a good fortune out of it.“If there’s one thing you learn by working on a lot of different Web sites, it’s that almost any design idea-no matter how appallingly bad-can be made usable in the right circumstances, with enough effort.” - Steve Krug

                    “Whether we’re fighting climate change or going to space, everything is moved forward by computers, and we don’t have enough people who can code. Teaching young people to code early on can help build skills and confidence and energize the classroom with learning-by-doing opportunities.” - Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Group
